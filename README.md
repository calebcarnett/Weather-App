#  Weather APP
This project challenged me to use third party APIS and use CSS knowledge of flexboxes to create a responsive design without using a CSS framework. This was my first time working with an API and was challenged to pull weather updates from a weather API. To make some improvements to this project, I would not have my search history repeat the same city and not save random text if it is not a valid city. Also my history is a bit buggy and doesn't always change the current city. Overall this challenge taught me a lot about API's, javascript, CSS, and pushed me to look back on prior activites/projects and apply them. 
## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
